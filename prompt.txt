dont add the scale effect on the hero section items its not good keep it simple.
also when I click on get started it should scroll to that section smoothly.
also updated the scroll bar in the chat area that complements the website color theme (dark).

These are the current files update the new code according to these files.

okay I have this project in react vite and flask. I want to add a speech to text option in chat area with the chatbot. use the easy way to do this.

the chat bot response is also not displayed in exact formatting as the bot is sending but the extra whitespaces and new lines are removed that looks very bad. keep the formatting as it is in the chat area.

also add current mood status in the suggestions that are given in chat area (I mean make then prompts dynamic according to the current mood).

also add an update if there is no emotion detected or any error occurs in emotion detection then it shows a message that "no emotion detected" and the current emotion is set to "no emotion" and the rest of things based on this new emotion.

also the app.tsx is too messed up or big. is there is any way to break it into different major components or into different files. try it.

add a facts section for random facts according to the current mood and also for no emotion.

keep the app.tsx concise not too big.
